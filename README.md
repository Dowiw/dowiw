# About me

This is my first time creating a readme for my profile!
Hopefully it will turn out well.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a java calculator.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on food.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with programming in general.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about strawberries.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he
- âš¡ Fun fact: Programming was not on my radar at all. When I wanted to make things, it was not really clear to me how I would do so, but I fell in love with software so I will push through! :)
